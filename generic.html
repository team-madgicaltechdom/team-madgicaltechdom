<h2>IT industry has a very very interesting paradox.</h2> 

<p>On the one hand companies are looking for talent especially fresh talent. It’s not easy to find. We’ve all struggled in finding the right college pass outs, we’ve all struggled in training them and the most frustrating part we’ve struggled with is retaining the trained engineers who we worked so hard to make productive.</p>

<p>On the other hand you find a huge number of freshers struggling to get a foot hold in the industry. A lot of smart youngsters with great aptitude are struggling usually handicapped by lack of proper guidance or some small speed breakers that lead to rejection that break their confidence.</p>

<h2>We want to resolve this paradox.</h2>

<p>We find freshers with great aptitude and ability to work really hard. We train them and set them up on interesting and challenging projects.</p>

<p>We work with our client companies to understand their projects, systems and processes. We work with our clients to help them organise so that these talented freshers don’t just survive but thrive and show productivity as early in project as possible.</p>

<p>Frankly nothing we do is rocket science, it is simple things done with care that add up and Make A Difference.</p>

<h2>Areas of expertise:</h2>
<p>Education, News & Entertainment, E-commerce, Machine Learning & NLP solutions.</p>

<h2>Skills of our developers:</h2>
